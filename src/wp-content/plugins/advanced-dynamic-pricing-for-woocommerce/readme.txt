Let's review the most used types of discounts.

= Product Discount =
Product discounts in online stores refer to a reduction in the original pricing of items, offered for a limited time or under specific conditions.
[Examples of the simple discount rules](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/rules/frequently-created-rules/product-discounts-2/)

* Black Friday / Cyber Monday weekend (Percentage discount to the whole shop)
* Set discount on product
* Percentage discount for the selected variation
* Set discount for category
* Package having one position
* Set price for each item
* 3+ products by the fixed price per item

= Bulk Discount =
Advanced Dynamic Pricing for WooCommerce provides a convenient and effective solution for implementing [bulk or tier discounts](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/rules/rules-sections/bulk-discount/) in an online store.
[Example of the rules:](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/rules/frequently-created-rules/bulk/)

* Bulk Discounts based on quantities
* Bulk discount for Specific Categories
* Bulk Discount for Selected Product – Simple Product Type
* Bulk Discount for Different Variations (Qty based on variations)
* Bulk Discount for Different Variations (Qty based on all matched products)
* Tier Discount Example
* Role filter and bulk ranges as one rule

= Role Discount =
Role discounts, which offer price reductions based on customer status or roles (such as employees, students, wholesalers or loyal customers), can enhance profits by fostering stronger customer relationships and encouraging repeat purchases.
[Example of the rules:](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/rules/frequently-created-rules/role-discount/)

* Discount for First Orders (Registered Users only)
* Simplest rule for customer
* 10% discount for User Role – Contributor

= Cart Discount =
A cart discount helps increase profits by encouraging customers to buy more items to get a price reduction.
[Example of the rules:](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/rules/frequently-created-rules/cart-discount/)

* 10% discount if subtotal is greater than $100
* 15% discount if total number of quantities in the cart is above 6 nos
* 10% discount for items from Category A
* Set zero cost for all shipping methods for subtotal greater than $100
* Cart fee
* Cart discount -10%, on Friday
* Buy any 5 items, get 15% off the cart
* Fixed shipping price for all shipping methods for some countries

= Buy One — Get One =
The BOGO (Buy One — Get One) offer can boost profits by increasing total sales volume and attracting more customers.
[Example of the rules:](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/rules/frequently-created-rules/bogo-discount/)

* Buy 2 and get the same third with 50%
* Buy any 1 from Category A and get 1 from Category B
* Buy 10 Quantities of Product A and get cheapest among Product B, C or D
* Buy any items from Category A and get 20% discount on Category B
* Buy 3 for $10
* Buy 2 pair of sunglasses at $30
* Buy any tagged products and get ONCE same product
* Buy 20 and get 1, Buy 30 and get 2, Buy 40 and get 3 and so on

= Gifts =
Using gifts as part of a pricing strategy works like a discount but without lowering the product’s price directly.
[Example of the rules:](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/rules/frequently-created-rules/gifts/)

* Add free products based on subtotal amount
* Gift for selected model and colors
* Almost same rule, but use “exclude products”
* Free product only monday

= Buy 3 for X =
Offering a discount on some products sold together at a fixed price can significantly increase profits by encouraging customers to purchase more items at once
Example of the rules:

* [3 any products for 100](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/rules/frequently-created-rules/product-discounts-2/#s13)

= Discount cheapest product 50% (Pro) =
The discount on the second cheapest product helps increase profits by encouraging customers to buy this item instead of only choosing the cheapest one.
Examples of the rules:

* [Get 50% discount on the cheapest item in the cart (Pro)](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/rules/frequently-created-rules/product-discounts-2/#s2)
* [50% off for every 2nd item (Pro)](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/rules/frequently-created-rules/product-discounts-2/#s14)

= PRO version of the plugin has an ultimate sets of the pricing features for your store! =
* [Advertising section of the rule](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/rules/rules-sections/advertising-pro/) — boost up your sales and announce about the discount and the gifts using the power of the advertising!
* [Allow to choose the gifts](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/rules/rules-sections/free-products/) to your customers from the products’ list or even from the whole product category.
* Add the product automatically with the discount — [Auto Add to Cart section](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/rules/rules-sections/auto-add-to-cart-pro/) helps you to create the rule with the recommended product in the cart or add the product with the discounted price to the cart automatically.
* Use a lot of possibilities of the [cart discounts](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/rules/rules-sections/cart-adjustments/) — add the free shipping method, percentage fee, disable the appliance of the WooCommerce coupons or make a tax exemption.
* [Advanced discount conditions](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/rules/rules-sections/cart-conditions/) — create the discount by the cart condition on the subtotal, shipping method, or customer’s properties such as orders amount and sum of the spent amount by the customer.
* [Activating rule by the coupon and URL coupons](https://algolplus.com/blog/10-of-the-most-inspiring-advanced-dynamic-pricing-ideas/#Get_customers_to_be_active) — Activate any of your rule by the inputting the coupon code in the cart or on the checkout. Also there’s a possibility to  activate the rules by the URL. That makes more easy sending the coupons to the customers by the email.
* [Product Collection](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/exclusively-in-pro/product-collections-pro/) — convenient way to filter out the products on your store to create more discount strategies on your site such as a discount for the storage remains, zero-sales products and [moreover](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/exclusively-in-pro/product-collection-examples/).
* More ways to adjust your [product filter](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/rules/rules-sections/product-filters/) — create the 100% discount on the second cheapest product.
* [Exclusive rules type](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/rules/type-of-rules/) that allows to apply one of many discounts to the products.
* A lot of new flexible options in the plugin’s settings — Adjust your discount as you need it

== Installation ==

= Automatic Installation =
Go to Wordpress dashboard, click  Plugins / Add New  , type 'Advanced Dynamic Pricing for WooCommerce' and hit Enter.
Install and activate plugin, visit WooCommerce > Pricing Rules.

= Manual Installation =
[Please, visit the link and follow the instructions](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I increase prices in my shop? =
You should setup negative discount.
= The plugin slows down my site a lot. Sometimes the cart page just freezes. =
It seems your websitе calls external API to do shipping calculations.
Please, visit >WooCommerce>Pricing Rules>Settings>Calculation, mark "Disable shipping calculation" and check speed.
= Free product can't be added to the cart. I see message "Sorry, this product cannot be purchased." =
WooCommerce verifies product before adding to the cart. So this product must be published, in stock and has price defined.
= How can I hide original prices? =
It's a PRO feature. You should turn off option "Show striked prices" at tab Settings, for category and product pages.
= I don't see "For sale" badge for variable products =
It's a PRO feature. You should turn on option "Calculate 'On Sale' badge for variable products" at tab Settings, section Calculations.
= Is it compatible with WPML? WOOCS ? =
Yes.
= Compatibility with my theme/plugin =
Free and pro versions use same core, so you can test it using free version. [Please, visit the link to see detailed reply](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/faq/common-3/)
= How to allow customer to select free product =
You should create package rule and set zero price for free product. [Please, check 2nd example](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/rules/frequently-created-rules/bogo-discount/)
= How to customize bulk tables or row "amount saved" =
You should copy necessary file from folder “BaseVersion/templates” to folder “advanced-dynamic-pricing-for-woocommerce” (create it in active theme)
= The rules are not applied to orders if I use button "Add order" (>WooCommerce>Orders) =
This form adds new order directly to the database. But all pricing plugins work with cart items. Use our plugin [Phone Orders](https://wordpress.org/plugins/phone-orders-for-woocommerce/) to add backend orders.
= I can't change quantity or delete item from cart =
It's a conflict with another plugin which modifies cart items too. You should turn on debugbar and send us report/json file. [Read short guide.](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/settings-algol_pricing/debug/)
= I marked checkbox "Add products to cart at normal cost and add coupon...", but I don't see any coupons in the cart =
You should visit >WooCommerce>Settings and mark "Enable the use of coupon codes".
= I need custom cart condition =
You should be PHP programmer to do it. [Please, review sample addon and adapt it for your needs](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/developers-algol_pricing/custom-code-developers-algol_pricing/program-custom-condition/)
